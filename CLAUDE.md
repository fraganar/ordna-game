# Ordna Game - Project Documentation

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- Data: JSON files in `/data/` directory
- Hosting: Netlify with GitHub integration
- Local server: Python HTTP server

## Commands
- `python3 -m http.server 8000`: Start local development server
- `git add . && git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes
- `git push`: Deploy to production (automatic via Netlify)
- `./deploy.sh`: Quick deploy script (commit + push)

## Local Development
1. Start local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:8000`
3. Test both single player and multiplayer modes
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Deployment Workflow
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with local server (http://localhost:8000)
3. Run `./deploy.sh` or manually:
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
   - `git push`
4. Netlify automatically builds and deploys (1-2 minutes)
5. Check live site at your Netlify URL

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point
- `js/game.js`: Core game logic and question loading
- `css/styles.css`: All styling including responsive design
- `data/questions-grund.json`: Game questions with pack assignments
- `data/`: Directory for additional question files

## Important Notes
- App requires HTTP server (not file://) for JSON loading
- Questions are loaded asynchronously via fetch API
- CSS includes fixes for green line bug in decision buttons
- Game supports both single player and multiplayer modes

## Code Style
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Keep functions focused and well-named
- Maintain separation between data (JSON) and logic (JS)
- Use semantic HTML and responsive CSS
